This repository contains code for evolving stabilizers of a Quantum Error Correcting Code. The program starts with an initial set of stabilizers represented as a matrix and updates these stabilizers based on measurements performed on specific qubits. The initial state is assumed to be a graph state, where each node represents a qubit connected by Controlled-Z (CZ) gates. 
Features Graph State Initialization: Begin with a graph state that corresponds to the initial stabilizers. 
Stabilizer Evolution: Update the stabilizer matrix based on measurements performed on specified qubits. 
Flexible Input: Easily input initial stabilizers in matrix form. 
Measurement Handling: Specify which qubits are measured to determine the final stabilizer configuration. # Verification-of-Stabilizer-Evolution
